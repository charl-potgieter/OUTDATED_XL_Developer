Change to standard library mechanism
------------------------------------
Create ability to export code of all open workbooks

Revisit the Export Spreadsheet Metadata in spreadsheet BI 
 - Maybe have this option in addition or replace  VBA code export? --> but will first need to ensure it doesnt generate needless folders and files e.g. if no power queries exist)

Reconfigure ribbon and save down copy so it is upladed to github

Need to branch back into main

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:
