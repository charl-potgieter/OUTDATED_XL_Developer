SpreadsheetMetaData saving - maybe just save items used in spreadsheetcreator (nothing power pivot related)
 * Maybe get rid of the heading and category --> just keep it simple, especially given broadening of reporting sheet concept that I dont want to bring into developer spreadsheet
 * Zero gridlines on each sheet when it is created
 * Table (listobject) in fixed position

Continue to work on SaveStandardCodeLibraryAndImportIntoCurrentWorkbook():
  - Maybe also export all spreadsheetmetadata of XL_Developer when SaveStandardCodeLibraryAndImportIntoCurrentWorkbook so to enable any changes to the standard code modules to be pushed to the git repo
 - test if changes are saved ok


Any reason why standard code library can not be housed in this workbook?



Revisit the Export Spreadsheet Metadata in spreadsheet BI 
 - Maybe have this option in addition or replace  VBA code export? --> but will first need to ensure it doesnt generate needless folders and files e.g. if no power queries exist)

Create ability to export spreadsheetmetadata across all open workbooks

Incorporate the CreateSpreadsheet (from metadata) project into XL_Developer

Reconfigure ribbon and save down copy so it is upladed to github

Need to branch back into main

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:
