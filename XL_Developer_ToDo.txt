Continue to work on SaveStandardCodeLibraryAndImportIntoCurrentWorkbook():
 - need to only export ZLibItems, maybe add an optional prefix paramater to Sub ExportVBAModules which specifies that only modules with the relevant prefix will be exported
 - test if changes are saved ok


Any reason why standard code library can not be housed in this workbook?



Revisit the Export Spreadsheet Metadata in spreadsheet BI 
 - Maybe have this option in addition or replace  VBA code export? --> but will first need to ensure it doesnt generate needless folders and files e.g. if no power queries exist)

Create ability to export spreadsheetmetadata across all open workbooks

Incorporate the CreateSpreadsheet (from metadata) project into XL_Developer

Reconfigure ribbon and save down copy so it is upladed to github
