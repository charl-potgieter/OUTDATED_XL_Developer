* Potentially add powerqueries to the generation of metdata (and the spreadsheet creation)

To capture data e.g. spreadsheet report format (in Spreadsheet BI)
  - Could create a data capture sheet class
  - this is most probably something I want to do in XL Devloper
  - four columns item, validation type, validation and value
   - All but the value column are locked and protected
  - macro generates button to validate and capture
  - property dictates where the data is written

* Change the front table on XL_Developer to a zLib_ListStorage ? (table currently used for only saving last folder)
 

Check that the createspreadsheet still works if there are no tables in the workbook


Reconfigure ribbon and save down copy so it is upladed to github

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:
